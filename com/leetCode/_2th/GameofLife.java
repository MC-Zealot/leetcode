/**
 * According to the Wikipedia's article:
 * "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
 * dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical,
 * diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
 * article):
 * 
 * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
 * under-population. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to
 * the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies,
 * as if by over-population.. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors
 * becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. Write a function to compute the
 * next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be
 * updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use
 * their updated values to update other cells. 
 * In this question, we represent
 * the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would
 * cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How
 * would you address these problems?
